This project was designed as a assignment for BCU coding bootcamp.

This project uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript. My application emphasizes the use of Javascript to provide quiz questions and collect user data to choose whether the Q&A's are correct, this then gives a score, and appends a results page of results from the user input data.

This project has been deployed to GitHub Pages. To get this project up and running, you can follow the deployment link. Or, download the sources files to use this as a template.

#Prerequisites
I recommend Visual Studio Code To install this application, you will also need a text editor. 

Installing
Download the zip file, or use GitHub's guidelines to clone the repository to install this code
